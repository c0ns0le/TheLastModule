=========================================================

Just some little helpers and tools for the everyday work.

It´s very strange working with Github´s Markdown, so this and the LICENSE.md are the only content readable for Github´s site generator [Jekyll][Jekyll].

ONLY FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PURPOSE!!! DON´T USE FOR PRODUCTION!!!
